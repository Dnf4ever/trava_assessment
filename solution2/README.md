##Explanation

This approach offers an entirely frontend solution. The URL is encoded in base64. For retrieving the filters, the encoded string is decoded, again with Base64, and then applied to the tables. It's a simple, yet effective way to get this solved but it doesn't offer much in the way of security. This would not be my first suggestion, but if it's something the CEO needs done TODAY, it would work until we can get a more solid and secure solution in place.

##Pros and Cons of this approach
This approach has several benefits. It's entirely frontend-based, meaning there’s no need for a backend service to store and retrieve filter states. This keeps things simple, avoids extra server load, and eliminates the need for database or cache management. Since everything is encoded directly into the URL, users can easily share or bookmark filtered views without relying on external storage.

However, there are some drawbacks. The URL can still become quite long, especially with complex filters, since Base64 encoding adds extra characters compared to the raw JSON representation. A present security risk could also come from someone being able to recognize the base64 encoding and decoding it themselves, and so being able to extract possible sensitive information in this manner. Another limitation is that URL length restrictions in some browsers (usually around 2,000 characters) could become an issue with very large datasets. Finally, since the state is stored only in the URL, users who clear their browser history or navigate away without saving the link won’t be able to recover their previous filters.
