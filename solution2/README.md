##Explanation

This approach offers an entirely frontend solution. The URL is encoded in base64 and then hashed in sha-256. For retrieving the filters, the process is done in the opposite direction. It's a simple, yet effective way to get this solved but it doesn't offer much in the way of security. This would not be my first suggestion, but if it's something the CEO needs done TODAY, it would work until we can get a more solid and secure solution in place.

##Pros and Cons of this approach
This approach has several benefits. It's entirely frontend-based, meaning there’s no need for a backend service to store and retrieve filter states. This keeps things simple, avoids extra server load, and eliminates the need for database or cache management. Since everything is encoded directly into the URL, users can easily share or bookmark filtered views without relying on external storage. Additionally, Base64 and SHA-256 ensure that the data remains compact and tamper-resistant while still being human-readable in its encoded form.

However, there are some drawbacks. The URL can still become quite long, especially with complex filters, since Base64 encoding adds extra characters compared to the raw JSON representation. SHA-256 also introduces unnecessary overhead in this context—while it provides a stable hash, we’re not actually verifying data integrity, so it might be overkill when a simple Base64-encoded JSON string would suffice. Another limitation is that URL length restrictions in some browsers (usually around 2,000 characters) could become an issue with very large datasets. Finally, since the state is stored only in the URL, users who clear their browser history or navigate away without saving the link won’t be able to recover their previous filters.
